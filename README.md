## Introduction
DISCO-RT is an adaptation of the original DISCO model, designed to generate high-quality human images and videos across varied backgrounds, poses, and human attributes. Through fine-tuning, DISCO-RT demonstrates improved generalizability and compositionality, aiming for lifelike visual synthesis in complex, real-world environments.

## Features
- **Enhanced Realism**: Generates high-quality images with detailed human features.
- **Generalizability**: Adapts well to new subjects and backgrounds.
- **Compositional Control**: Achieves flexible compositionality, enabling customized human synthesis.
- **Applications**: Social media, virtual reality environments, personalized educational content, and more.

## Installation
